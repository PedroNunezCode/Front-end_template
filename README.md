# I'm tired of installing packages whenever I start a new project.
### The following repo contains a few packages that can help you get your React project started.


- React
- SASS
- Babel
- Webpack
- All the css loaders required to run.

I also tried to create a decent project structure so if anybody uses this,  you can easily navigate through the project and make additions.
## Installation

This repo requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd Front-end_template
npm i
npm run start
```
